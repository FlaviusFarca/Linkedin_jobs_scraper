If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.

BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY

There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.

Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.

Thе challenge аhеаd:
 Game Testers perform an important role in game development: testing, analyzing, and recording, any flaws or “bugs.”
Testing the game in a systematic way, analyzing the game's performance against the designer's intentions, reporting problems, and suggesting improvements. However, it also involves creativity, which is used to figure out how to ‘break’ the game in different and unique ways.

In effect, Testers are the game's first audience by reporting on play-ability and identifying any aspects that could be improved. Testers are responsible for finding these bugs in a game before it goes public and assuring quality in the final product.

Game testing involves playing the same game repeatedly, testing different levels and versions or revisions of the game. You must be able to stay motivated since the quality of the final product depends on your work. Sometimes, different teams oversee specific sections or areas of a game. You must be professional when communicating with other team members. You must also be able to anticipate different ways the game will be played by people around the world, and test accordingly.

Perks at the office:

· Fresh fruits, very good coffee and tea any time at your discretion
· Relaxation rooms with console games and other different activities for when you need to unwind during your breaks
· Additional free days for Christmas - NYE period (Except the bank holidays - some extra vacation time)
